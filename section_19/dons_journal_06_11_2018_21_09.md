## 1. All about Modules
A module is a container of modules are constants.
Constants are values that will not change during or after the program execution.
Modules can be used within a class.
Modules cannot initiate an object state.
To define a module, we use the "module" keyword.
Best practice is to also use the UpperCamelCase when naming a module.
And also ending the module with the suffix "able".
The "self" keyword in a module allows the module to be called within the module.

*Example*
```
    # Let's create a module called BillCalculations and use the self keyword to output the class of the object.

    module BillCalculations

        def self.bill(items)
            items.reduce(0) { |num, sum| sum + num }
        end

        def self.vat(bill)
            bill * .16
        end

    end

    # we can now test them
    table_2 = [80, 20, 120, 40]

    p bill = BillCalculations.bill(table_2) # 260
    p tax = BillCalculations.vat(bill) # 41.6

```


## 2. Calling a Module
To call a module, we can use the "require" or "require_relative" methods.

*Example*
```
    # Let's assume our module in #1, we saved it as BillCalculations.rb. We can now refer to it in another ruby file by simply using the require method.


    require_relative "BillCalculations.rb"
    customer_order = [700, 2100, 900]
    new_bill = BillCalculations.bill(customer_order) # 3700
    new_vat = BillCalculations.vat(new_bill) # 592.0
    p total = new_bill + new_vat #4,292.0

```


## 3. Ruby Default Modules
Ruby also has other modules that we can use ourselves at any time. Some are also loaded thus we don't even need to call them. Best example is the Math module.

*Example*
```
    # Let's create try using the Math module for some calculations.

    p Math::PI # 3.145...
    p Math.sqrt(9) # 3

```


## 4. All about Mixins
A mixin is simply a module that is called within a class.


*Example*
```
    # Let's make a mixin using the Comparable module

    class Restaurant
        def initialize(name, rate)
            @name = name
            @rate = rate
        end # end of initialize method
        attr_reader :rate

        include Comparable

        RESTAURANT_RATING = { "Tano" => 5, "Nne" => 4, "Tatu" => 3}

        def <=>(other)
            if RESTAURANT_RATING[rate] < RESTAURANT_RATING[other.rate]
                -1
            elsif RESTAURANT_RATING[rate] == RESTAURANT_RATING[other.rate]
                0
            else
                +1
            end # if statement
        end # spaceship method

    end # end of class

    bar = Restaurant.new("Loft K", "Tano")
    pub = Restaurant.new("Road Show", "Tatu")

    p bar < pub

```


## 4. Mixins in Multiple Classes
A mixin helps deal with the single inheritance property of Ruby as you can load it in multiple classes.

*Example*
```
    # Let's create a module, include it in a class, and create various classes and test available functions

    module LipaNaMpesa
        def paybill(business_no, amount)
            "MJI3840X KES #{amount} sent successfully to #{business_no} at #{Time.now}"
        end

    end

    class Restaurant
        include LipaNaMpesa
    end

    class Shop
        include LipaNaMpesa
    end

    class Kitchen < Restaurant
    end

    loft_kitchen = Restaurant.new
    p loft_kitchen.paybill(007007, 3250)

    geek_store = Shop.new
    p geek_store.paybill(333333, 54084)

    arbys = Kitchen.new
    p arbys.paybill(123456, 300)

```
