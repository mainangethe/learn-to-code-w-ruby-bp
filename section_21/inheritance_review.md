# Inheritance Review
Inheritance is a way for a class to obtain all methods from another class.
Inheritance avoids duplicate code across multiple classes.
The class inherited from is called the Super/parent class.
There class that inherits is calle dthe Sub/child class.

Ruby only supports single inheritance. A class can only inherit from one other class.

The Subclass is a type of the Superclass. This is called an "Is-A" relationship.
Thus, the Subclass can be called a subset of the Superclass.

The r/ship does NOT apply in reverse. A Car class is a Vehicle but a Vehicle is NOT
guaranteed to be a Car.

To create a Subclass are followed by a < symbol and the name of the superclass.
