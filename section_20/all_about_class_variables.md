# Class Variables & Class Methods
A method and variables that are attached to classes and not objects

# Classes Variables
some pieces of data extend beyond the scope of a single object.
A class variable solves the issue of data duplication across instances.
They store information that does not pertain to an object.

# Class Method
It is a method available on the class rather an instance.
They contain functionality that does not involve one instance.
They can be called even if objects / instances do not exist.
Best example - the new method

# Sytanx
