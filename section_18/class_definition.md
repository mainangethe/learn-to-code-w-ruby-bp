**Classes**
A class is a blueprint / template / pattern / outline of creating unique objects

**Objects**
An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class

**Instantiation**
It is the process of creating an object from a class

**Object attributes** (instance variables)
These are variables that belong to the object.
Attribute provide info about the objects current state

**Instance methods**
These are methods that interact with the object. They belong to the object

**Encapsulation**
 is an OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object.

A class is called an abstract type. It hides the complexity of interacting with the data. The same way methods abstracts the complexity of a process.
