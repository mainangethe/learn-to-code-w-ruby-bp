## 1. The Time Object
The time object is used to store date and time.
To define it , you use the Time class and it's .new method.
You can also use the .now method.



*Example*
```
    # Let's create a time object for the current time
    # the new method without any args will simply assume you want the time now
    # you can also use the .now method

    now = Time.new # it should show the current time
    now2 = Time.now # should show you the current time
    p now == now2 # true


    # Let's create the day and time we opened the restaurant
    # You can specify both the date and specific time (up to the second)
    loft_kitchen_openning_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6) # 6am, 1st of OCT, 2018

```

## 2. Available Instance Methods
You can use various methods to evaluate the time method.
Methods available:
.month, .year, .day, (evaluates the date)
.hour, .min, .sec, (evaluates the time)
.yday(day of the year), .wday (day of the week)


*Example*
```
    # Let's evaluate the restaurant opening date

    lk_opening_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6)

    p lk_opening_date.year # 2018
    p lk_opening_date.month # 10
    p lk_opening_date.day #1

    p lk_opening_date.hour # 6
    p lk_opening_date.min # 0
    p lk_opening_date.sec # 0

    p lk_opening_date.yday # 274
    p lk_opening_date.wday # 1

```

## 3. Available Predicate Methods
You can use various predicate methods to evaluate the time method.
Methods available:
.monday? .. .sunday? (evaluates the day)
.dst (evaluates whether the particular date was in the daylight savings time)


*Example*
```
    # Let's evaluate the restaurant opening date with a predicate method

    lk_opening_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6)

    p lk_opening_date.monday? # true
    p lk_opening_date.dst? # false

```

## 4. Available Comparable Methods
You can use various comparable methods to evaluate the time method. You can also use the .between method to compare a range of dates.
 > Methods available: >, <, <=, >=, ==, !=


*Example*
```
    # Let's evaluate the restaurant opening date based on other dates

    lk_opening_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6)

    today = Time.now
    q4_start = Time.now(2018, 10, 1)

    lk_opening_date < today # false
    lk_opening_date.between(q4_start, today) # true

    # you can pass a time object directly
    lk_opening_date == Time.new(2018,1,6,10) # false

```

## 5. Adding and Subtracting Time
You can add or subtract time.
To add we use the "+" plus symbol.
To subtract we use the "-" minus symbol.
For both adding and subtracting, Ruby uses seconds.


*Example*
```
    # Let's add and subtracting the restaurant opening date based on various time

    lk_opening_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6)

    today = lk_opening_date + (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) # 30 days after it opened
    last_month = lk_opening_date - (60 * 60 * 24 * 30) # 30 days before it opened

```

## 6. Converting Time Objects to other objects
One can convert the time object to other Ruby objects.
We use the "to_s" to convert the time object to a string.
We use the "to_a" to convert the time object to an array.

*Example*
```
    # Let's convert the restaurant opening date to a string and an array

    lk_opening_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6)

    string_option = lk_opening_date.to_s
    p string_option # "2018-10-01 06:00:00 +0300"
    p string_option.class # String

    array_option = lk_opening_date.to_a
    p array_option # [0, 0, 6, 1, 10, 2018, 1, 274, false, "E. Africa Standard Time"]
    p array_option.class # Array

```

## 7. Converting Time Objects to a Formatted String
You can be able to convert the time object to a human readable date.
We use the String From Time method (.strftime).
The method also has directives that are used to tell the method how you want the output.
Directive examples:
> %b (displays the abbreviated version of the month), %Y (Four-digit version of the year)



*Example*
```
    # Let's format the restaurant opening date using the strftime method

    lk_opening_date = Time.new(2018, 10, 1, 6)

    pretty_option = lk_opening_date.strftime("%d %B %Y")
    p pretty_option # "01 October 2018"

```

## 8. Extending more methods using the 'time' class
There is the 'time' subclass that is not loaded by Ruby by default.
To use it you need to add the require keyword then the 'time'
Options available include the .parse and the strptime methods.
The strptime method does the exact opposite of strftime method. Also uses the same directives.



*Example*
```
    # Let's get the restaurant opening date from a string
    # Remember we need to load the 'time' class

    require 'time'
    date_in_string = "2018-10-01"
    lk_opening_date = Time.parse(date_in_string)
    p lk_opening_date # 2018-10-01 00:00:00 +0300

    object_option = Time.strptime(date_in_string, "%Y-%m-%d")
    p object_option # 2018-10-01 00:00:00 +0300

```
