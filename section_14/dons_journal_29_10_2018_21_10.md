## 1. The Yield Keyword
The yield keyword is used when you want to exit the method and do other computation in a block.
We use "yield" in the method.
After the methods completes running, it implicitly returns what it last did to the method.
Thus never use return in the block method.



*Example*
```
    # Let's create a restaurant menu with a yield outside

    def menu_creation
        puts "Inside the method"
        puts "We will be creating a menu"
        yield
        puts "We are now back in the method"
        puts "Menu creation completed"

    end # end of method

    menu_creation do
        puts "We are now in the block"
        menu = { pilau:80, chai: 20, mandazi: 10 }
        puts menu
    end # end of block

    # you can also use the yield multiple times

    def menu_creation
        puts "Inside the method"
        puts "We will be creating a menu"
        yield
        puts "We are now back in the method"
        puts "Leaving now"
        yield

    end # end of method

    lk_menu = menu_creation do
        puts "We are now in the block"
        menu = { pilau:80, chai: 20, mandazi: 10 }
    end # end of block
    p lk_menu

```

## 2. Block Given Method
When we use the yield keyword, the method has to be given a block when running it otherwise it will throw an error.
To help overcome this, we use "block_given?" to verify if the method has been given a block, if yes then we can yield else stay within the method.
This is a predicate method. Always evaluates to True / False.
We also use it with the if statement to evaluate it within the method.



*Example*
```
    # Let's check what happens if I yield without a block
    def menu_item_creation
        puts "We are in the method"
        puts "Leaving to execute in a block"
        yield
    end # end of method

    menu_item_creation # this will throw an error

    # let's recreate it using the block given condition

    def menu_item_creation_reworked
        puts "We are in the method"
        puts " Leaving now to go execute in a block"
        if block_given?
            yield
        else
            puts "I didn't leave since there is no block"
        end # end of if

    end # end of Method

    menu_item_creation_reworked # no errors thrown


```

## 3. yielding with arguments
You can also exit from a method to a block with arguments.
You simply add them to the yield keyword.
To add multiple, you simply use the "," comma to signify multiple arguments.



*Example*
```
    # Let's create a menu

    def breakfast_menu_creation
        breakfast = []
        puts "We will be creating a Breakfast Menu"
        yield breakfast
    end # end of method
    lk_bf = breakfast_menu_creation { |breakfast| breakfast << "Bread,80"}
    p lk_bf # [ "Bread, 80" ]

    # Sending multpiple arguments
    def full_menu_creation
        breakfast = []
        lunch = []
        yield( breakfast, lunch )
        puts breakfast
        puts lunch
    end # end of method

    full_menu_creation do |breakfast, lunch|
        breakfast << "Bread,10"
        lunch << "Githeri, 70"
    end # end of block

```

## 4. All about Procs
Blocks are very useful, they help us execute uniquely from what a method was supposed to do. However, a block is not an object. This means, you can not save it to a variable, you cannot call methods to it, and it is terminated after execution.
This is now where Procs come in. A proc is a saved block. And most importantly, it is an object.
To create a Proc, we call the Proc class.
And to use a proc in a method we use the "&" ampersand symbol.

*Example*
```
    # Let's create a proc that does conversion to another currency

    my_currency = [100, 150, 250, 1000]
    to_usd = Proc.new { |kes| kes * 0.00983 }
    to_gbp = Proc.new { |kes| kes * 0.00768 }
    to_euro = Proc.new { |kes| kes * 0.00864 }
    to_zar = Proc.new { |kes| kes * 0.14407 }

    p kes_to_usd = my_currency.map(&to_usd)
    p kes_to_pound = my_currency.map(&to_gbp)
    p kes_to_euro = my_currency.map(&to_euro)
    p kes_to_zar = my_currency.map(&to_zar)

```
